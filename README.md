# CALCULATOR

Simple calculator made by a teenager addicted to shitpost.

## How to use

Press buttons to do operations and other stuff, or use keys instead (key_binds.txt).

## Important information

I'm not smart enough to make this work like a normal calculator, so if you want to use any of the following operations, you'll have to have a number (and not an
operation) on the input box, and THEN click the operation button:

- Factorial (!)
- Sine (sin)
- Cosine (cos)
- Tangent (tan)
- Square root (√)
- Cube root (∛)
- Logarithm (log)

Thanks for making this kid feel important.
